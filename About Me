# Dr. Stover's About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/people/deannastover/) in Newport News, Virginia. I specialize in Digital Humanities (DH), Victorian Literature, and Children's Literature. My work often deals with the intersection of these three topics, such as in [my digital edition of H.G. Wells's *Little Wars*](https://scholarlyediting.org/2017/editions/littlewars/intro.html) (1913).

I'm currently working on expanding this project to include a critical edition of Wells's *Floor Games* (1911). Both *Floor Games* and *Little Wars* are about play with toy soldiers, so I'm rethinking how **digital** editions can invite and even necessitate **physical** engagement. As part of this, I am working with a designer to create 3D printable versions of the civilian miniatures Wells and his illustrator imagined in *Floor Games* for users to download and then print themselves.

In addition, I'm organizing a digital edition of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wall-paper." This edition, which will compare the manuscript and periodical versions of Gilman's work, will heavily involve students. They will do the first round of coding, and I am hoping to work with a student on designing the interface and drafting the critical introduction. It will truly be an edition *by* students *for* students.

But back to games. They're not only central to my scholarship, but also to my personal life. In my spare time, I play Dungeons & Dragons and other Role Playing Games, or RPGs. Currently, I'm playing [Curse of Strahd](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/curse-strahd), a game about vampires--another major interest of mine.

I have two wonderful cats who like to interrupt my games and work.

I graduated with my PhD in English Literature and graduate certificates in Digital Humanities and Women's and Gender Studies from Texas A&M University in August 2020. My BA is from Arizona State University, where I majored in English Literature with a Classical Certificate in Latin. I am also a member of [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/) and one of my little-known passions is working with students in prison. I've been lucky enough to teach in two prisons and I hope to do more of this work going forward.
