**Summary:**
 
The project I am reviewing is a digital hub regarding information of late 1800’s English figure Charles Booth and his attempts to clean up his home city of various problems on the street including drugs, alcohol, and poverty. The project aims to inform readers not only on the state of London in such a dire time but how the actions of one man helped turn the situations for many a working-class citizen for the better. Charles Booth’s London utilizes a set of notebooks, journals to give a in-depth view on how this force for good helped cut through what was a rough patch in English history. The site additionally includes maps of the city at the time to put the reader in late 1800s London to view the cities rampant poverty outbreak and how it changed over the years of Booth's influence. Lastly, the site informs readers much on the character himself and his life story from the son of corn merchants to a philanthropist and social reformist.

**Purpose:**
 
Charles Booth’s London clearly aims to be an informative piece on English history and on how this man changed the lives of an entire city over the years through hard work and a dedication to his home. The chosen medium is an interactive user interface that divides into sections of other smaller sub-pages each with their own theme regarding the information. Maps, journals, and standard informative webpages are all used to effectively to give an interactive experience to the readers through putting them back into the time the events all took place. Maps of 1800’s London and the journals from Booth himself both act to give a new perspective for anyone reading about the social reform that might not know what it would be like to have experienced it first hand.

**Critics:**
 
The site does however lack in some respects. When first opening the page, it fails to fully explain the project and what it's about without having to dig into the page more. I would have liked to see a smalle snippet or paragraph upon first opening the site, so I knew exactly what kind of information was being offered. How it currently stands someone may open the site and get confused as to the main premise causing them to lose intrest before looking further. Other than that, the site does contain an “about” section that explains the mission of the project in more detail I just believe it would function to get readers attention more if the website started itself with explaining it's goal from the moment someone views it to hook peoples attention.

**About the Site:**
 
The website does however give great evidence to the information it contains by getting its credibility from primary sources of the explained period. Journals and maps are time peroid approprate some having been written at the time the events took place. The evidence is then gathered on the site through small links to sub-sites which a reader can navigate through at their own pace. All the primary sources are integrated into the site allowing a viewer to manipulate them as they wish, scrolling through the written pages and searching over the various maps.

Currently the site does not list how it was programed such as what language was used however it does state its affiliations and how its design was obtained. The project was funded by the London School of Economics and Political Science and was developed by Mickey & Mallory, a website domain page. However, no one person is credited with the page’s creation that I could find. All of the works and maps are also provided through the library and its connections.

**Findings:**
 
Overall, the project does its job as an archive of London’s economic and political history. It tells the tale of a single man's influence in the social reform of what was once a city stricken with poverty and crime. *Charles Booth’s London* is an effective use of digital humanities as an archive of our most important and informative pieces of the past. Through its creative and interactive ways to explore countless maps, journals, interviews, and statistics it acts to perform far better than its normal article counter parts for the gathering of historical data.
