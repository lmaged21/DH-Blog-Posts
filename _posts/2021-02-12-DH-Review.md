**Summary:**
 
The project I am reviewing is a digital hub regarding information of late 1800’s English figure Charles Booth and his attempts to clean up his home city of various problems on the street including drugs, alcohol, and poverty. The project aims to inform readers not only on the state of London in such a dire time but how the actions of one man helped turn the situations for many a working-class citizen for the better. Charles Booth’s London utilizes a set of notebooks writing by the man himself to give a in depth view on how this force for good helped cut through what was a rough patch in English history. The site additionally includes maps of the city at the time to put the reader in late 1800s London to view the cities rampant poverty outbreak and how it changed over the years of Booths influence. Lastly, the site informs readers much on the character himself and his life story from the son of corn merchants to a philanthropist and social reformist.

**Purpose:**
 
Charles Booth’s London clearly aims to be an informative piece on English history and on how this man changed the lives of an entire city of the years through hard work and a dedication to his home. The chosen medium is an interactive user interface that divides into sections of other smaller projects each with their own theme regarding the information. Maps, journals, and standard informative webpages are all used to effectively to give an interactive experience to the readers through putting them back into the time this all taken place. Maps of 1800’s London and the journals from Booth himself both act to put the time into perspective for anyone reading about the social reform at the time.

**Critics:**
 
The site does however lack in some respects. When first opening the page, it fails to fully explain the project and what its about without having to dig into the page more. I would have liked to see an about page upon first opening the site, so I knew exactly what kind of information was being offered. How it currently stands someone may open the site and get confused as to the main premise the site offers. Other than that, the site does contain an “about” section that explains the mission of the project in more detail I just believe it would function to get readers attention more if the website started itself with explaining its goal from the moment someone views it.

**About the Site:**
 
The website does however give great evidence to the information it does have by getting its credibility from primary sources of the explained period. Journals and maps are all written at the time the events took place and gathered on the site through small links to subsites. All the primary sources are integrated into the site allowing a viewer to manipulate them as they wish, scrolling through the written pages and searching over the various maps.

Currently the site does not list how it was programed such as what language was used however it does state its affiliations and designers. The project was funded by the London School of Economics and Political Science and was developed by Mickey & Mallory, a website domain page. However, no one person is credited with the page’s creation. All of the works and maps are also provided through the library and its connections.

**Findings:**
 
Overall, the project does its job as an archive of London’s economic and political history. It tells the tale of a single mans influence in the social reform of what was once a city stricken with poverty and crime. Charles Booth’s London is an effective use of digital humanities as an archive of our most important and informative pieces of the past. Through its creative and interactive ways to explore countless maps, journals, interviews, and statistics it acts to perform far better than its normal counter parts for the gathering of historical data.
