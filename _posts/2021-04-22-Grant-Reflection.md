## Grant Process and Reflection on Digital Humanities

When me and my partner sat down to think about what we wanted to do our project on we decided to take a look at ourselves. Feeling it would work best if we researched something we were passionate about we decided to turn to our love of games and specifically our love of world favorite table-top RPG Dungeon and Dragons. As advent players of the game, we decided to use Dungeons and Dragons in a way that can benefit people in the way that represents digitals humanities. By using modern tools such as the 3D modeling program Blender as well as Text Encoding Initiative as a coding language we thought we could bring this old time classic to the modern era with an online program meant to aid individuals in getting started. Often players find it too difficult to first get into the game either due to the overwhelming number of things to learn or even due to the rather expensive nature of the core materials and books, so our main goal was to allow people in these situations a easier alternative. Eventually this developed into an idea that focused on our program acting as a sort of tutorial instructing new players in ways, we hope would end up far less confusing than simply reading the books on your own. We are not the first to do something like this as other programs exist to assist players however they tend to have a focus on those who have at least a little experience with the system such as the popular DnD Beyond. Our program differs in that it is less used as something to track created characters and exists to wean completely new players into what is a rather complicated game.

Creating the documents for this project has really clarified the one question I’ve always had since the start of this semester; what is digital humanities? Looking back at the beginning of the year my ideas of what counted at digital humanities were unfocused at best. I saw trends such as the interactivity, the online presence, and the overall betterment of society but that never entirely answered the question for me. When starting on this project and working to include something I loved into digital humanities I finally got the bigger picture behind what exactly counts as a work of digital humanities. It is the study of human nature put into the modern era. As we grow and advance as a society our ways of thought are constantly changing. New breakthroughs become history faster than ever and people are constantly pushing for the betterment of our civil situation. Where these ideas interest with the modern world we can find digital humanities. It’s a field that grows ever more important as our technology advances as to not forget the physical amidst the cyber space. History, social justice, culture, all of it can be contained within the digital world and spread across the globe, and that is where digital humanities derives its importance.

Out of all the projects performed over the course of the semester I believe my favorite had to be working with the short story The Yellow Wallpaper. Not only was it an interesting story to delve into but it took my writing skills somewhere I never expected to need them in the form of TEI. After taking a programing class in high school I had always thought of coding as tedious and boring but when working with TEI I realized that some languages don’t have to be a struggle just to get working. It was a simple to use coding language that allowed a beginner like me to work through it with little to no trouble single handily overwriting those bad memories of high school programing. Additionally, we got to work with a real-life example of digital humanities and take part in a project that will actually see use in the real world. Not only is it amazing to see your work make an impact but it’s another tool and experience to put on a resume for when the college years are behind me.

Overall, this class drastically improved me as a writer in a way I didn’t think I needed. It allowed me to experience writing in an area I wouldn’t expect such as writing blog reviews, grants, environmental scans, and other such digital works. I often find that in the English classes I take the modern world is often neglected for the classics, but that kind of tunnel vision blinds us from what writing actually is in the modern era. Not every writer wants to be a novelist or a playwright. Writing can take many forms in the digital world and this class epitomizes that ideal which I greatly appreciated. It has been a fun and informative trip working through this digital humanities class.
