My name is Logan Maged and I am currently enrolled at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) as a junior.
I intend to major in English and minor in Philosophy with the additionally I aim to obtain a concetrated focus in writing.
As one of my passions in life writing is a big part of my aim for a future career specifically involving fiction.
My leading goal is to spend my life tapping into my creative side and using my knowledge of fiction writing for some kind of media such as television, movies, or video games.'
 
As a junior nearing the end of their college career i've attempted to broaden my horizon for my writing in attempts to become a more well rounded author.
I will often spend spare time writing short stories or other forms of print trying my hand at many different styles including some writing for a popular horror site the [SCP Wiki](http://www.scpwiki.com/) and literary journalism involving some of the volunteer work im interested in. In my opinion trying new things is important to making a well rounded writer and promotes creativity on the page so I try not to shy away from opportunities.
 
Along with my school work I believe that some of the best experience comes from giving back to the community. For the past few years i've worked as a writing tutor and editor for students struggling in all kinds of writing including fiction, analytical writing, scientific journalism, and creative nonfiction. Working through some of the common mistakes others make helps me better myself and see what I normally can't in my own writing. Outside of volunteer work I am also adament about working to help the [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/) obtain enough blood from donors to ensure we can save lives in our communities when the time comes. I donate ever few months when i'm able and have worked to set up blood drives at my high school previously.
 
Outside of the busy life of education and volunteer work I use my spare time immersing myself in other forms of fictional media whether it be reading, watching a show, music or playing a new game. I've been big on video games since I was a kid and had built my first desktop by the age of fourteen (with a little help of course) for the purpose of keeping up with all the new releases. I'm a big fan of Japanese culture and enjoy listening to music, playing games, and watching shows from Japan. I've been studying the language myself in hopes that one day I'll become fluent and perhaps vist the place myself, but for now I will just have to enjoy what I can of the culture here. Additionally I'm also a big fan of table top RPGs like _Dungeons and Dragons_ (Having recently finished [Curse of Strahd](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/curse-strahd)) and use my interest in writing to create whole new characters and worlds for my friends to explore. 
 

 
Lastly, if I'm not doing any of the above I'm probably messing with my completely insane dog. He's crazy but he's still my dog so I love him all the same.
