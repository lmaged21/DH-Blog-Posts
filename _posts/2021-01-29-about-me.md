My name is Logan Maged and I am currently enrolled at Christopher Newport University as a junior.
I intend to major in English and minor in Philosophy. 
Additionally I aim to obtain a concetrated focus in writing with my English major as writing is one of my passions and what I hope to focus on in my future career.
