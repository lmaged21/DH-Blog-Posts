**Summary:**

The Global Jukebox is a project dedicated to the collecting and sorting of music from around the world based on data such as time period, country, and classification. The site has a detailed collection of music from around the world including information on each song such as artist, genre, and even instrumental composition. A variety of tabs allow the user to sort through the worlds music and check the cultures of many other places around the world in order to find what is most popular for any given time within that culture. The site incorporated a variety of graphics all of which are interactive to aid the user in narrowing down their search and finding the music they are looking for. The site overall is very eye catching and pretty making it an overall fun thing to interact with especially due to the well-made graphics and charts.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of the site is to collect and categorize all music in the world based on a given set of variables. It is an educational site that prides itself on being a voice of cultural equality by spreading the music of cultures around the world for anyone to discover through the site. It also aims to educate the user on the patterns withing music and music culture from other countries and cultures. Many of the graphs act to find these patterns among music and display them to the user so they may discover their own new music from other places outside their culture. It acts as a piece of history as in every culture there is a new unique form of music that constantly evolves and changes over time. To be able to track the cultural history of things like this ensure an inclusive and well-educated society. The Global Jukebox also does this in a very fun and creative way even using games or systems where users can code their own music. There is such a large number of things to do on the site I can only recommend checking it out for yourself.

**Critics:**

The site is very pretty but at times the extensive use of colors and graphics can be overwhelming to the user. It can be difficult to navigate and use as the site doesn’t openly tell how to use all the graphics or exactly what they are aiming to tell you. Upon opening the site, you are greeted with a large scroll wheel of text and a few tabs that lead to hard to read graphs and maps. I would prefer to see a more concise interdiction to aid readers and ease them into the idea of the site. Collecting all of international music history is a big task and readers can easily get lost in all the information so I believe a more simplistic approach to an introduction would do a lot for this site. Additionally, I would have like to see explanations and keys along with every graph in map that help you figure out how to use each of the graphics. The draw of the site is its interactive nature however without detailed instructions all the interactive maps and graphs are rather hard to use and make navigation difficulty at times.

**About the Site:**

The site has extensive credits given to the makers of the site and the science behind the categorizing of the music however I was unable to find the exact code used to create the site. Despite reading through the credits, about the site, and scouring the site itself as a whole I could not find any clue as to what technology was used to create the site. It was a little disappointing to see as whatever system they used it is quite advanced as the types of interactive programs on the site are quite advanced and difficult to make.

**Findings:**

Overall, the site is very intriguing and provides an interesting new way to inform users on the cultures of music and dance around the world. Its highly interactive and every user can have their own experience with the site. While being a little difficult to use at times once you get over that learning curve you can view all kinds of new music from anywhere in the world. The site acts as a record for one of humanities biggest cultural entities and promotes diversity among music lovers by providing new sources of foreign music culture. Sites like this are important for us to assure a diverse identity that includes all manner of cultures far and wide. The Global Jukebox hits right on the mark as one of these sites and I highly recommend it to those who love music as much as I do.
